# IMP-X-FDR

## Features

This software provides an easy to use and automated way for calculation of the real false discovery rate (FDR) of crosslink search results obtained from any peptide-library system. It is a valuable tool for testing novel crosslinkers, to compare acquisition strategies or to benchmark crosslink search algorithms.

Additional functionalities are the comparison of crosslink IDs found from different replicates or across different search engines using Venn diagrams as well as to investigate intrinsic properties (mass, pI value, amino-acid sequences analyses, ...) of the crosslinks dependent on retention time. The tool thereby allows a comparison of the physicochemical properties of identified crosslinks vs those theoretically formed within the peptide library used.

## Getting started

### Software requirements
> **Note that the tool is only compatible to Windows at the moment.**

In order to run the application you need the following software installed:
- [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.3-windows-x64-installer)
- [Python 3.9 (or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Missing packages will be installed automatically

### Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/fstanek/imp-x-fdr/releases/latest)
2. Unpack the archive
3. Run `IMP_X_FDR.exe`

After downloading IMP-X-FDR to any local directory, simply execute “IMP_X_FDR.exe”
In case of missing supporting programs -like Python- on your system, you will be automatically redirected to the respective installation website. Install the suitable version for your computer.
